---------------------------------------
## draft in dir: manuscript
- [x] GenHMM algorithm flow/steps
- [x] LatHMM algorithm flow/steps
- [ ] Generator shared HMM derivatives/algorithm
- [ ] Planning application design of HMM powered by Generative Models.

## implementation in dir: code
Flow model takes the batch size as a parameter for constructing model structure, we need take this into consideration.
